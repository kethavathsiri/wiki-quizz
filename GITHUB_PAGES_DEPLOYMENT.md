# Frontend Deployment to GitHub Pages

## Overview
The Wiki Quiz Generator frontend has been successfully deployed to GitHub Pages and is accessible at:
**https://kethavathsiri.github.io/wiki-quizz**

## Deployment Setup

### What was configured:

1. **package.json Updates:**
   - Added `"homepage": "https://kethavathsiri.github.io/wiki-quizz"`
   - Added deployment scripts:
     - `npm run deploy` - Builds and deploys to GitHub Pages
     - `predeploy` - Automatically runs build before deploy

2. **GitHub Pages Configuration:**
   - gh-pages npm package installed
   - Build artifacts deployed to `gh-pages` branch
   - GitHub Pages is configured to serve from the `gh-pages` branch

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - `.env` - Development API URL (http://localhost:8000)
   - `.env.production` - Production API URL (needs to be configured based on your backend deployment)

## How to Deploy

### Initial Deployment (Already Done)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
npm run deploy
```

### Future Deployments
After making changes to the frontend, deploy with:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run deploy
```

This will:
1. Build the production bundle with the correct `--base` path
2. Push the contents to the `gh-pages` branch
3. GitHub Pages will automatically serve the latest version

## Configuration Required

### Backend API URL
Update `.env.production` with your backend API endpoint:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
```

If your backend is hosted separately (not on GitHub Pages), ensure:
- CORS is properly configured on your backend
- The API endpoint is publicly accessible
- SSL/HTTPS is used for production

## Current Status

✅ Frontend deployed to GitHub Pages
✅ gh-pages branch created and active
✅ Accessible at: https://kethavathsiri.github.io/wiki-quizz
⚠️ Backend API URL needs to be configured in `.env.production`

## GitHub Pages Settings

The repository is configured with:
- **Source:** Deploy from a branch
- **Branch:** gh-pages
- **Folder:** / (root)

## Notes

- The build folder is created with the correct path prefix `/wiki-quizz/`
- All React routing is handled client-side
- For custom domain setup, update the GitHub repository settings
- Commits to `gh-pages` branch are auto-generated by gh-pages package

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see updates:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check GitHub Pages deployment status in repository Settings → Pages
